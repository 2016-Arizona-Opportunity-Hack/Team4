These are all the files required to create a wordpress instance based on the website created during the PayPal Opportunity Hack by Team 4, for the nonprofit Amanda Hope. All the files (BESIDES the .sql file). The SQL file must be imported into a SQL database. If you are using PHPMyAdmin, you can create a table called "wordpress" (WITHOUT THE QUOTES. IT HAS TO HAVE THIS NAME TO WORK WITH THIS DATABASE FILE, UNLESS YOU MODIFY THE DATABASE FILE). Then, use the import tab to import the SQL file into the empty wordpress table you just created. The wordpress files need to go into the directory that the server points to, and then you can run the server and set up your information as needed.
